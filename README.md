# Desserts Page

This project is a simple web page for showcasing desserts. It allows users to add desserts to a shopping cart, view the total number of items in the cart, and clear the cart.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Display desserts with their names, prices, and categories.
- Add desserts to a shopping cart.
- View the total number of items in the cart.
- Clear the shopping cart.

## JavaScript Approach

The JavaScript code utilizes modern ES6+ syntax and DOM manipulation to add functionality to the webpage:

- **Event Listeners**: Event listeners are used to handle user interactions such as clicking buttons. For example, the "Add to cart" button has an event listener to add the selected dessert to the shopping cart.
- **Classes**: The `ShoppingCart` class is used to manage the shopping cart functionality. It includes methods for adding items, calculating totals, and clearing the cart.
- **DOM Manipulation**: The JavaScript code interacts with the HTML DOM to dynamically update the content of the webpage. For example, when a dessert is added to the cart, the total number of items is updated dynamically without reloading the page.
